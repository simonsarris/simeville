### A 2d village

This is meant to be the background to [simonsarris.com](https://simonsarris.com), once it looks nice. The current [simonsarris.com](https://simonsarris.com) is a pure CSS background (including the birds) but is not interactive.

There is much to do, see the issues, and the bad art

## demo

You can see it live, here: https://simonsarris.github.io/simeville/

Right now:

* click to create houes (above tree line)
* click IT'S TIME TO BUILD when it is time to build
* drag sun down to see moon + stars
