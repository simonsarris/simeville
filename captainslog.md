## IT'S TIME TO BUILD

Finally becoming a little village. Added a button to build lots of things at once. It works but its very random. To look good, choreography is needed.

Some cleanup has been done on building.js, but oh boy is more needed.

We are almost out of tea, and just in time, the weather's so hot I have wanted nothing but espresso and a beer.

Haven't had much time to work on this! I hoped to be farther along by now.

I'm adding some building templates, and tried to make a few pixel-art-ish towers, but I'm very bad at this part.

One possibility here is to pay someone else to do the art, but then any time I want to add something I'll need to bug them again, or else try to copy their style, so it would make updating anything in the future more onerous. Besides I really should have better art chops w.r.t. digital illustration.

My cat caught his first rodent today. Proud of him.

w e w lads. Added a stars.png with constellations, that rotates. Photoshopping this well is gonna take a really long time.

Perhaps just leave it as it is for now.

Behold, dear reader, the Moon.

Let us all try to be more like the Moon.

Now working with images for sky and foreground. FEELS GOOD. Sky is parted out into its own layer (boo) but now z ordering and independent sky darkening (less dark) works (yay).

gotta get a moon and put it on a pulley with the sun, which I hope has a somewhat amusing effect.

I'm thinking of paying someone to make the graphics? It will probably take me forever if I try to do it. But then it will be harder to adapt and change it later.

Lots new: Bezier easing animated building! Sun! Dragging the sun! Stars (that shine through buildings). Darkness! We're at like 3-4 days of gods own creation rn.

Dammann freres tea came in so I'm high on that earl grey yin zhen xoxo

HIGH TEST UPDATE LOOP. I think I won't bother with loop invalidation, since we'll want little things moving all the time anyway.

Instead, we should bake things into layers and decline to draw most? layers as the animation happens. This could be done with multiple canvases, or in-memory canvases.

anyway: let there be animation.

Wew lads. Just a little time to put in here but wanted to allow click-creating to go with click selecting (I can use a checkbox or whatever to toggle).

Flipping looks OK for houses. Next up I need different kinds of buildings. I'm still concerned that this won't look good aesthetically, but I need to build out stuff like the positioning, animation manager, manipulation tools anyway.

Imbibed the final curieux tonight. Out of beer and tea! Something's in the bureau de poste for the tea problem.

Back at it. I'm concerned that I won't be able to get a *pretty* scene out of a procedural canvas village. I'm considering switching to pixel art instead. :(

Anyway starting the town class, adding containsPoint, adding click/selection functionality, that sort of thing. I know this isn't strictly necessary, but will help with debugging later. Besides, what if people want to interact with the houses eventually?

I probably? won't log much here, there's always the [website captain's log](https://github.com/simonsarris/site-simonsarris/blob/master/captainslog.md) instead.

This project is starting with the idea of recreating a Sebastian-Munster like village scene,
but I will probably diverge wildly on aesthetics. I'm really liking https://twitter.com/soapdpzel right now.

Had a nice pot of jardin bleu this morning.
