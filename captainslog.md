### Captain's log, Feb 1st, 2020

I probably? won't log much here, there's always the [website captain's log](https://github.com/simonsarris/site-simonsarris/blob/master/captainslog.md) instead.

This project is starting with the idea of recreating a Sebastian-Munster like village scene,
but I will probably diverge wildly on aesthetics. I'm really liking https://twitter.com/soapdpzel right now.

Had a nice pot of jardin bleu this morning.
